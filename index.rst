# Pre-commit Keyword Checker üìù‚úÖ

Welcome to the Pre-commit Keyword Checker! This handy pre-commit hook checks for specified keywords in the files being committed. It offers file exclusion options and customizable keyword lists to make sure your commits stay keyword-free!

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Install the pre-commit package if you haven't already:
   
         pip install pre-commit-keyword-checker

2. Add the following content to your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, replacing `yourusername` with your GitHub username:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/AliYmn/pre-commit-keyword-checker
    rev: master
    hooks:
      - id: check-keywords
        args: ["--keywords", "KEYWORD1", "KEYWORD2", "--exclude-files", "file2.txt"]
````

Replace KEYWORD1, KEYWORD and file1.txt with your desired keywords and excluded files.


1. Install the pre-commit hook to your project:

    pre-commit install

And you're all set! üéâ

# Usage
Once installed, the keyword-checking pre-commit hook will be run whenever you commit changes in your project. If any of the specified keywords are found in the files being committed (excluding the specified files), the commit will be blocked, and the script will display a list of keyword errors.

You can also run the pre-commit hook manually:

    pre-commit run check-keywords

And you're good to go! üöÄ
# Configuration

  --keywords: A list of keywords to search for in the files being committed. If this argument is not provided or left empty, the script will exit without checking the files.

 --exclude-files: A list of files to exclude from the keyword check.
